  <h1>Whatis Birb Club about?</h1>
  <p>Well, really, Birb Club is just showing off our birds. We love them a lot: They are really cute!</p>
  <p>Also we're just doing this for fun, posting pictures of our birds and stuff like that.</p>
  <p>We only have 2 members, and only one of them know Computer Programming. All the websites we made doesn't have proper updating dates because it's hard to keep up.</p>
  <p>In fact, this website ain't gonna get an update for a while because there's nothing to update!</p>
  <p>The more we add to the main website, the more websites we'll have to make. That's gonna be it for the information.</p>
