<p>HI. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.</p>
<i class="fas fa-dragon"></i>
<p>So... This is Birb Club! It's mainly about birds. Also, I made this out of Computer Programming(CP for short)and... well, Foodie World is missing out. They denied my offer for a custom made website, so now I'm turning this website into Birb Club. Also, DFS(Da Foodie Squad)I know this is going to occure when we grow older: The website main link is https://foodiesquaddfs.github.io but just because the link has your Squad name in it, doesn't mean it's yours. I don't want to waste PC space and make a new website, so the link stays that way. Who knows, we might actually meet at a court and debate about everything when we grow older.</p>
<p>wow, did your really read all that?</p>
<img src="xiao bai dan 2.png" alt="The Creator is a dumbass. A.K.A. H.Y.(Creator's initials) the dumbass, because she forgot to download this picture.">
<p>This is The Creator's bird. The Creator isn't the leader of Birb Club because S.L.(Leader's initials)is the leader. They have no control over this website, but they can send me some pictures and I'll insert it into the website. S.L., please give me some pictures.</p>
<p>wow, did you really read all that?</p>

<p>The Creator's Gmail is: derpychicken1000@gmail.com. Be sure to contact her if you want some of your bird photos featured!</p>
<p>Also, side note, we're not grown-ups yet. Birb Club isn't doing any official business deals, if you want to adopt a bird go somewhere else.</p>
<p>You can't scam us, either. We're old enough to be self-aware, but not old enough to do ANY business deals.</p>

<img src="xiao huang xiang chi cai.jpg" alt="The creator is a dumbass. Don't ask me why.">
<p>Well...this bird wants to eat.</p>
<img src="xiao huang chi cai.jpg" alt="The creator is a dumbass.">
<p>YES! THE BIRD FINALLY ACHIEVED HIS GOAL TO EAT THE LETTUCE! HOORAY! WE MUST CELEBRATE!</p>
<img src="party bird.jfif" alt="The Creator is a dumbass.">
<p>This bird's been celebrating. Let's join in!</p>
<img src="party birb 2.jfif" alt="The Creator is a dumbass once again lol">
<p>We've completed the mission of celebrating. Doesn't that kind of look like Springtrap from FNaF?(Five Nights at Freddy's)</p> 


<p>Enough with messing around with the pictures, let's do something else.</p>
<i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> <p>Until we get an official icon, this will have to do.</p> 
<i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> <i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> <i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> <i class="fas fa-dragon"></i>
<p>Get the message yet? Do you know our new logo? It's not even ours XD</p>

<h1>What is Birb Club about?</h1>
<p>idk, we have no idea either.</p>
<p>Just kidding, we know a lot. Birb Club is about birds, we love them a lot. We're trying to convince other people to love them too, but we can't do that in our small organization that' not even official on Gmail. Birb Club's only got 2 members! The Creator of this website, and the leader. The sooner you come, the higher your rank will be.</p>
<p>Also, you know what I said about the link of this website? Well, the Foodie World I know isn't official yet, so we're not breaking the copyright rules. Millets are for birds, and since Millets are bird food then that just explains the link to this website. I really cna't believe how long these 'paragraphs' are! LOL!</p>
<p>We're gonna make a Map, so my apologies for the next image you see. It's quite disturbing.</p>

}
