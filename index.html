<p>HI. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.</p>
<i class="fas fa-dragon"></i>
<p>So... This is Birb Club! It's mainly about birds. Also, I made this out of Computer Programming(CP for short)and... well, Foodie World is missing out. They denied my offer for a custom made website, so now I'm turning this website into Birb Club. Also, DFS(Da Foodie Squad)I know this is going to occure when we grow older: The website main link is https://foodiesquaddfs.github.io but just because the link has your Squad name in it, doesn't mean it's yours. I don't want to waste PC space and make a new website, so the link stays that way. Who knows, we might actually meet at a court and debate about everything when we grow older.</p>
<p>wow, did your ealy read all that?</p>

<p>This is The Creator's bird. The Creator isn't the leader of Birb Club because S.L.(Leader's initials)is the leader. They have no control over this website, but they can send me some pictures and I'll insert it into the website. S.L., please give me some pictures.</p>
<p>wow, did you realy read all that?</p>

<p>The Creator's Gmail is: derpychicken1000@gmail.com. Be sure to contact her if you want some of your bird photos featured!</p>
<p>Also, side note, we're not grown-ups yet. Birb Club isn't doing any official business deals, if you want to adopt a bird go somewhere else.</p>
<p>You can't scam us, either. We're old enough to be self-aware, but not old enough to do ANY business deals.</p>
