<p>HI. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.</p>
<i class="fas fa-dragon"></i>
<p>So... This is Birb Club! It's mainly about birds. Also, I made this out of Computer Programming(CP for short)and... well, Foodie World is missing out. They denied my offer for a custom made website, so now I'm turning this website into Birb Club. Thank you for allowing me to do this, Sophia. You're the leader ;)</p>
<img src="xiao bai dan 2.png" alt="The Creator is a dumbass. A.K.A. H.Y.(Creator's initials) the dumbass, because she forgot to download this picture.">
<p>This is The Creator's bird. The Creator isn't the leader of Birb Club because S.L.(Leader's initials)is the leader. They have no control over this website, but they can send me some pictures and I'll insert it into the website.</p>
<p>wow, did you realy read all that?</p>
